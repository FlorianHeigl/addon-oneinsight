RealOpInsight oneInsight
========================

Description
--------
RealOpInsight oneInsight, or simply oneInsight, is a visualization add-on enables that allows 
to have an overview of the load of OpenNebula-managed hosts. oneInsight provides differents 
kinds of loads mapping, including for each host the mapping of:

* CPU used by virtual machines (VMs)
* Memory used by VMs
* Effective CPU usage (CPU used by all system processes, including 
  processes outside VM)
* Effective memory usage (memory used by all system processes, including 
  processes outside VMs)

Oerview of oneInsight
---------------------
oneInsight a fully HTML/Ajax/JJavascript stack built from modern Web libraries, 
such as, RaphaÃ«lJs, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

A typical installation consist of the following components:
 
* A backend shell script ``curl-xml-rpc.sh`` to frequently pool host information
  via the OpenNebula's XML-RPC API. 
* A crontab entry to periodically run the pooling script. 
* A Web frontend served by a Web server, Apache or any other Web servers. 


Getting Started
===============

Installation
============
In a typical installation, oneInsight can be deployed on the OpenNebula 
server. But you're free to install it on any server from where you can 
access the OpenNebula XML-RPC API.

Requirements
------------

On server side
--------------
oneInsight should work out-of-box on the vast majority of Linux operating systems 
subject to that they have the following tools:

  * curl command line interface
  * The Bash interpreter
  * The cron time-based job scheduler
  * A Web server like Apache and nginx 


On client side
--------------
All computer with a modern web browser should be sufficient. However Chrome, 
Firefox, Opera or Internet Explorer higher than IE7 are recommended.  


Get the Software
----------------
Go to the software home and download the latest tarball: 
http://realopinsight.com/oneinsight.

You can get the latest development versions via our Github repository:

Installation Directory
----------------------
There is no special consideration about the installation directory, but below 
we consider an installation from the directory ``/opt/oneinsight``. Feel free to 
use another installation directory. In this case, think to adapt the installation 
path in the commands provided throughout this guide.

Securiry Considerations
-----------------------
oneInsight is fully Javascript/HTML based and doesn't provides any security mecanism.
However, there are options to improve the security of your deployment.

Authentication and Authorization
--------------------------------
To add authentication support when accessing the Web frontend, a simple way is to 
use the basic HTTP authentication enabled by your server. Most of modern web servers
enable this. 

Below are steps needed to setup basic HTTP authentication with Apache:

* To go the oneInsight Web installation directory
* Edit a file named ``.htaccess`` with the following content:

    ```
    <Location /opt/oneinsight>
    AuthName "oneInsight"
    AuthType Basic
    AuthBasicProvider file
    AuthUserFile /opt/oneinsight/passwords
    </Location>
    ```

* Create the password file with a initial user named oneinsight
  ```
   htpasswd -c /var/oneinsight/passwords oneinsight
  ```
  You'll need to have sufficient permissions to write into the directory /var/lib/oneinsight

Ciphering
---------
As for authentication, you can deploy the web frontend of oneInsight so to benefit from the SSL support of your Web server. Consult the documentation of your Web server for more details.
